# Home Screen UI - React Native CLI Task

This project is a submission for the **Fresher Developer Test Task**. It replicates the **Home Screen** from the provided Figma design using **React Native CLI** (no Expo), focusing on modular structure, clean UI, smooth animations, and good development practices.

##  Key Decisions & Assumptions

- **React Native CLI** was used as per requirement.
- Used **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability.
- All **design values were matched pixel-by-pixel** based on the Figma reference.
- Icons were loaded via `react-native-vector-icons` and task images via local assets.
- Used the **Animated API** for the drawer transition (no 3rd party like `react-native-reanimated`).
- No external theming library was added for dark mode (for simplicity) but can be added via `react-native-paper` or Context API.
