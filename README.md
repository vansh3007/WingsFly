## 🧠 Key Decisions & Assumptions

- **React Native CLI** was used as per requirement.
- Used **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability.
- All **design values were matched pixel-by-pixel** based on the Figma reference.
- Icons were loaded via `react-native-vector-icons` and task images via local assets.
- Used the **Animated API** for the drawer transition (no 3rd party like `react-native-reanimated`).
- No external theming library was added for dark mode (for simplicity) but can be added via `react-native-paper` or Context API.
